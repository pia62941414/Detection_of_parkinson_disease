# Detection_of_parkinson_disease

Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative condition that mostly affects the motor system. Early signs that are most noticeable include tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, and trouble walking. With melancholy, anxiety, and apathy being common in many PD patients, cognitive and behavioural issues may also develop. 

In addition to sleep issues, Parkinson's patients may also experience sensory issues. A lack of dopamine results from cell loss in the substantia nigra, a midbrain area, which causes the disease's motor symptoms. 

The accumulation of misfolded proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons is thought to be the cause of this cell death, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Parkinsonism syndrome is the collective name for the primary motor symptoms.
